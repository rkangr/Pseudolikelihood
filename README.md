# Pseudolikelihood
Code used in the paper by R. Kangro, K. Kuljus and J.Lember about pseudolikelihood method for fitting mixed distributions

The aim of the code is to study properties of a new method for identifyng parameters of a gaussian mixture distribution from  data. The code is not optimized for computational efficiency not aimed to be used in practical modelling tasks.
